Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 
and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Thank you to [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for his excellent [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
